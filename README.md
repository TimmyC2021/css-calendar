Taking a simple calendar example from https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_calendar.asp
Moving the css and javascript into their own files
Making the creation of the dates 1st to last day month active so that it:
* places the 1st of the month on the right day
* responds to the number of days in the month
Making the < and > actively change the month backwards and forwards
Make the month clickable to quickly change to another month
