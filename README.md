# css-calendar
  1. Taking a simple calendar example from https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_calendar.asp
  2. Moving the css and javascript into their own files
  3. Making the creation of the dates 1st to last day month active so that it:
* Change the default to todays date, whatever that may be.
* Places the 1st of the month on the right day
* Responds to the number of days in the month
  4. Making the < and > actively change the month backwards and forwards
  5. Added << and >> to make the year changeable
  

The original example was for the month August 2021
